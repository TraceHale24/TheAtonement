        Christ came to the earth with many purposes, but the most of important of all of them was to pay the price for our sins. <br/>
        Even before this life he knew what he had to do, and he knew the purpose for his life, to save us, his brothers and sisters.

        However, according to Tad R. Callister in The Infinite Atonement this is the doctrine that many of us understand the least.
        What does it mean when people say the Atonement is "Infinite and Eternal"?

    </p>
    <p>
      <div class = "descriptions">
        <u>Eternal</u>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is easier to understand - The atonement is eternal because it is valid throughout time.<br/> This means that it covers everyone who:
        <ul>
          <li>Is Living</li>
          <li>Has Lived</li>
          <li>Will Live</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class = "descriptions">
        <u>Infinite</u>
      </div>
      <p>
        This one is a little more complex than Eternal, what exactly does it mean when we hear the Atonement is Infinite? According to Brother Callister, it means that it reaches all beings.<br/>
        This raises the question of beings from other worlds. According to church doctrine there should be other beings, and the Atonement that happened here on earth covered all of them.

        <u>Why it's imporant</u>
      </div>
      <p>
        At the center of our beliefs as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is the atonement. Everything else is just an appendage to the atonement. <br/>
        Without the atonement we would have no purpose here on earth, we wouldn't be able to over-come that spiritual and physical death. Then why is it that it is one of the most
        misunderstood topics in the church? Tad R. Callister does a good job of answering this question in his book The infinite Atonement.
